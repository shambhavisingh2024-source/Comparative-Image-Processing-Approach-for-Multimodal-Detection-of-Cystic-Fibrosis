Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting pulmonary function, requiring early detection for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as sweat chloride test and genetic screening, provide limited functional lung assessment. This study explores imaging-based CF detection using X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), leveraging machine learning for automated classification. We implemented a multi-modal approach using Image preprocessing, lung segmentation, edge detection, feature extraction and classification using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) with K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier for X-ray, LOOCV with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel for CT, and Linear SVM with LOOCV and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction for MRI. Results show that MRI combined with PCA and SVM yields the highest accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness despite data limitations.<img width="507" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec33043b-1e64-4140-bd69-bd97fd334540" />
